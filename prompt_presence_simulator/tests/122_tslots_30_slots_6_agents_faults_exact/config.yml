  header: 122 tSlots, with exact number of failure nodes - Each slot independently, randomly selected or not with arbitrary probability
  description: |
    Each agent (transmitter) runs a tSlots strategy, independently selecting constant t-size set of slots
    to transmit in. Success is obtained only when each of nodes hits at least one slot when only it does broadcast.
    Tolerance is varying
