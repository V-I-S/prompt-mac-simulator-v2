  header: 141 Bernoulli Trials - Each slot independently, randomly selected or not with arbitrary probability
  description: |
    Each agent (transmitter) runs a Bernoullis trial for each slot independently, with given probability occupying the slot or not.
    Success is obtained only when each of nodes hits at least one slot when only it does broadcast.
    Tolerance is varying
